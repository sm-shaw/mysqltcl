MSQLTCL INSTALLATION

(1) Install Tcl/Tk according to its installation instructions.

(2) Install mSQL according to its installation instructions.

(3) The msqltcl distribution comes in a file called
msqltcl-X.Y.tar.gz, where X.Y is the release number. cd to a directory
under which you want the msqltcl directory to be created. Then,

   gzcat msqltcl-X.Y.tar.gz | tar xvf -

This will create a new directory called msqltcl-X.Y in the current
directory and unpack the msqltcl source files in the new directory.

cd into the new directory.

The next step depends on whether you have other Tcl/Tk extensions to
integrate. The two standard options that come with msqltcl are

   (a) plain Tcl/Tk

   (b) add extended Tcl (tclX/tkX)

The third option,

   (c) Tcl/Tk with an arbitrary set of extensions, requires
       more hands-on activity on your side.

(3.a: Plain Tcl/Tk; you have no other Tcl/Tk extensions.)
Edit the Makefile configuration definitions. You may ignore the
section containing tclX/tkX definitions. In the same directory, enter
one of the following commands, depending on your version of Tcl/Tk,

-- Tcl pre-7.4, Tk pre-4.0:

   make w/tcl

-- Tcl 7.4, Tk 4.0 (betas):

   make w/new-tcl

This should create two executables: msqltcl and msqlwish.

(3.b: Add extended Tcl, tclX/tkX.)
You must first install tclX/tkX according to its installation
instruction.

Edit the Makefile configuration definitions, including the section
containing tclX/tkX definitions. In the same directory, enter one of
the following commands, depending on your version of Tcl/Tk,

-- Tcl pre-7.4, Tk pre-4.0:, TclX pre-7.4:

   make w/tclX

-- Tcl 7.4, Tk 4.0, TclX 7.4 (betas):

   make w/new-tclX

This should create two executables: msqltcl and msqlwish.

(3.c: An arbitrary set of Tcl/Tk extensions should be integrated.)
In this case I guess you already have some experience with Tcl
extensions.

Still edit what's obvious in the msqltcl Makefile configuration
definitions.

What I usually do is to compile the various extensions in order to
have them create their libraries. Some insist on making executable
interpreters, and I don't stop them, but rather delete unwanted
interpreters afterwards. Then I collect all initializations into one
central 'tclAppInit.c' and 'tkAppInit.c' (or 'tclXAppInit.c' and
'tkXAppInit.c' if tclX/tkX is involved).

Either put the two AppInit files in the msqltcl directory, or
somewhere else.  Make sure the msqltcl Makefile to reflects reality,
and you might be able to use it.

In the msqltcl Makefile: Add to the include path, if required by the
AppInits. Add the other extension libraries to the list of libraries
required to link Tcl and Tk. Also add any necessary object
files. (Some extensions, like msqltcl, don't create a library, but
only an object file.) Then a 'make w/tcl' or 'make w/tclX', whichever
is appropriate, should create the executable interpreters.

Or you may prefer to do it in a completely different way. After all,
msqltcl consists of just a single C source file, so it's easy to
handle.

Sorry if this is too sketchy, but it is a matter of taste how Tcl
extensions are handled, and taste varies a great deal in this respect.


MMON (MINI-MONITOR) INSTALLATION

Please note that this version of mmon does not work with Tk 4.0. A new
version will soon be released.

Also note that mmon requires TclX. After compiling with 'make w/tclX'
you should be able to run mmon with the following command,

   msqlwish -f mmon &


DOCUMENTATION

The msqltcl man page is in file 'msqltcl.n'. There is no automatic
installation for it. A PostScript version is in 'msqltcl.ps', an ascii
version in 'msqltcl.doc'.

mmon has online help, but no man page.
