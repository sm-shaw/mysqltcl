# Requirements
you need mysql at least 3.22
and tcl at least 8.1
for Tcl8.0 download old mysqltcl-2.0rc6

>./configure
>make
>make install

Configure option --with-tcl=dir
set include path to dir/include

To compile mysqltcl you need tcl header files.
(tcl.h tclInt.h)
By Suse these files are not a part of tcl package (tcl.rpm)
but are moved to tcl devel package (tcld.rpm)
Suse Personal Edition does not contain tcld.rpm.
So you must download it per ftp first if you are
not owner of Suse Profesional Edition.

RedHat usere do not have this problem.

Using mysqltcl from tcl

load path_to_lib/libmysqltcl.so

see test.tcl for example

The configure script search for tclsh
Some distribution have only tclsh8.0 or tclsh8.3
so you must preapre a symbolic link from your tclsh8.? to tclsh
as root

cd /usr/bin
ln -s tclsh8.? tclsh

If the configure script fail
you can use Makefile.org file 
Probably you must edit the file first
Try

cp config.org config.h
make -f Makefile.org
